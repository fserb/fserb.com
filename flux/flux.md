A digital garden is a collection of notes, post, comments. There are several good explanations
of it like [maggie's](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and [how the blog broke the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/).

Here are some principles to keep in mind while reading:

* everything is a draft
* Curation and interlinks over date-ordering
* Fuck pagination
